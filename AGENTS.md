# Agent instructions (CSPy)

This folder contains teaching materials (notes + notebooks). When editing or generating content here:

- Write student-facing text in clear, correct English.
- Prefer small, step-by-step notebooks over large cells with many concepts at once.
- Explanations go in Markdown cells; avoid explanatory `print()` calls.
- Keep code minimal and correct; avoid cleverness.
- Target Python ≥3.13; use modern type hints (e.g., `str | None`, `list[str]`).
- Don’t add new dependencies unless there is a clear teaching reason.
- If you change links in a Markdown file, ensure targets exist relative to this folder.

If you need broader repo conventions, also read ../../AGENTS.md.

    "**How AI Agents Help with Debugging:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Explanation**: AI can translate cryptic error messages into plain language and suggest fixes\n",
    "- **Code Analysis**: Identify potential bugs or anti-patterns in your code\n",
    "- **Solution Generation**: Propose fixes or alternative implementations\n",
    "- **Learning Aid**: Explain *why* something went wrong, helping you avoid similar issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Interaction:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You: Why am I getting 'list index out of range'?\n",

    "    Check if your loop range matches your list length.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "- ✅ Use AI to understand error messages\n",
    "- ✅ Ask AI to review your logic\n",
    "- ✅ Learn from AI explanations\n",
    "- ⚠️ Always verify AI suggestions\n",
    "- ⚠️ Don't blindly copy-paste code without understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- AI doesn't have runtime context (can't see your variable values)\n",
    "- May suggest solutions that don't fit your specific use case\n",
    "- Cannot replace understanding of fundamentals\n",

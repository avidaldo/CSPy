    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Instructions**: Use `print()` for output, variables for storage, and `input()` for user data\n",
    "2. **Single-Line Instructions**: One instruction per line is best practice\n",
    "3. **Multiple Instructions Per Line**: Avoid using semicolons - it's bad practice\n",
    "4. **Multi-Line Instructions**: Use implicit continuation (parentheses, brackets, braces) or explicit backslash\n",
    "5. **Console**: Python REPL is great for testing and learning\n",
    "6. **Indentation**: Critical in Python - use 4 spaces per level\n",
    "7. **Comments**: Use `#` for single-line and `\"\"\"` for docstrings\n",
    "8. **Text Editors**: Many options available - VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types Covered\n",
    "- **Numeric**: int, float, complex\n",
    "- **String**: text data with many methods\n",
    "- **Boolean**: True/False values\n",
    "- **Collections**: list, tuple, dict, set\n",
    "- **None**: represents absence of value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators Covered\n",
    "- **Arithmetic**: +, -, *, /, //, %, **\n",
    "- **Comparison**: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=\n",
    "- **Logical**: and, or, not\n",
    "- **Assignment**: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.\n",
    "- **Identity**: is, is not\n",
    "- **Membership**: in, not in\n",
    "- **Bitwise**: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Conversion\n",
    "- **Implicit**: Python does automatically when safe\n",
    "- **Explicit**: Use int(), float(), str(), bool(), etc.\n",
    "- **Operations**: Be mindful of type compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "✅ Write clean, readable code\n",
    "✅ Use descriptive variable names\n",
    "✅ Comment complex logic\n",
    "✅ Follow PEP 8 style guidelines\n",
    "✅ One instruction per line\n",
